%-- like `i.rescued dogs` from `i.dogs` %--

for example, as I mentioned, Applicative and Cognitive Grammar considers phrases
as `q.applications` of (something like) linguistic or cognitive functions,
with (say) an adjective modeled as a function applied to a noun,
to yield a different noun (viz., something playing a noun's conceptual role)
`cite<Descles2010>;.
