   visualization as well as textual/tabular displays, employing Reactive 
   Programming techniques to coordinate multiple visible windows.  For example, 
   visual cues direct attention to selected samples represented via 
   expanded rows (\circled{1}), color-highlighted 2D regions (\circled{2}), 
   and color-highlighted 3D bars (\circled{3}).  The main, 2D, 
   and 3D windows are functionally linked so that the same sample is 
   highlighted/expanded in each display window.}};
