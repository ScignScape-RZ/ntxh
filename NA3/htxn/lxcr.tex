%\noindent\lun{Overview}
\fontfamily{ptm}\fontsize{13pt}{18pt}\selectfont
{\sectsp}
\p{This paper will summarize the \LXCR{} document 
object model and plugin 
framework and discuss its 
applications for testing, education, and the 
development of test and test-preparation materials.  
\lLXCR{} combines the requirements of a 
generalized, multi-format Document Object Model 
with specifications for embedding document-viewing 
as well as document-preparation tools inside 
software applications.}

\p{The \LXCR{} Document Object 
Model defines a protocol for examining document structure 
which recognizes the dictinct structural features 
of different manuscript formats, such as 
\LaTeX{}, \XML{}, Concurrent Markup, and 
graph-oriented markup formats such as \RDF{}.  
In short, \LXCR{} offers a common representation for 
publications structured as either \LaTeX{} or 
\XML{}/\HTML{} documents (or a combination of the two).  
Conceptually, the \LXCR{} Document Object Model effectively 
extends the \XML{} Document Object Model (\DOM{}) 
to incorporate unique features of \LaTeX{}, \RDF{}, 
and Concurrent Markup paradigms, features which are not 
internally part of \XML{} and therefore not directly 
represented by \XML{}'s \DOM{}.}

\p{Complementing \LXCR{}'s Document Object Model 
(\LDOM{}), the \LXCR{} Plugin Framework (\LPF{}) 
presents a standard model for embedding publication 
tools into software applications --- in particular, 
scientific and/or multimedia applications which 
permit users to view specialized technical information 
and/or multimedia content.  \lLXCR{} is designed for a 
contemporary publishing industry where individual 
books and articles are only one part of a network 
encompassing text, data, and multimedia resources.  
Traditionally, the digital version of a published 
document could be fully provided in a single 
file --- most often, a \PDF{} (Portable Document 
Format) resource.  While \PDF{} files remain the 
primary format for readers to initially find and 
view publications, contemporary publishers often 
prioritize enhancing this primary document with 
one or more secondary resources --- ranging from 
multimedia files which help readers visualize or 
interactively experience data presented in the 
publication, to analytic code or data sets which 
help readers evaluate or even reproduce research 
findings.  Given this data- and multimedia-oriented 
publishing ecosystem, it is important that publishing 
software --- both tools for authors to create documents and 
tools for readers to fully experience them --- 
properly model and implement networks which can 
integrate disparate reading, technical, and multimedia 
applications into a unified e-reading platform.
}

\p{Insofar as a full publication package (not just  
primary books/articles but also data sets, 
computer code, or multimedia files) encompasses 
many different kinds of digital resources, 
it is no longer adequate to consider one 
single application (e.g., a \PDF{} viewer) 
as \q{the} e-reader used to access a publication.  
Instead, a network of distinct applications may be 
needed for readers to experience all facets 
of the publication package.  This is especially 
true for publications which are linked to supplemental 
files that require specialized software.  As a 
concrete example, chemistry or biomedical papers may be 
linked to Protein Data Bank files, which in turn 
are used by molecular-visualization software to 
create \ThreeD{} graphical representations of 
protein structures.  In order for readers to 
experience this multimedia content, their document 
viewer must be able to launch and/or send signals to 
the proper molecular-visualization applications, and 
these applications in turn must know how to respond to the data 
sent from the document viewer.  Such inter-operability 
can be achieved by embedding plugins in both applications; 
most of the inter-application integration is then achieved 
by the plugins communicating with one another.  
}

\p{This paper will present further information about both 
aspects of \LXCR{} --- the Document Object Model and the 
Plugin Framework.  To be clear, though, these two 
dimensions are closely interrelated.  The data pertinent 
to inter-application networking, in the context of 
creating and reading publications, is closely linked 
to document structure --- which in turned is expressed 
by a Document Object Model.  For example, each 
supplemental multimedia resource (such as \ThreeD{} graphics) 
is especially relevant at specific locations in the 
publication text.  Interactive \ThreeD{} views of a 
chemical compound (or analogously biological or physical  
entities such as viruses, tissue samples, vector fields, etc.) 
are most helpful to the reader in conjunction with 
locations in the text where that specific chemical, biological, or 
physical phenomenon is discussed.  Continuing the 
above example, links to Protein Data Bank files should be 
embedded at the point in a publication where the protein is 
mentioned or analyzed.  It is not 
sufficient, that is, simply to note that a given 
multimedia file is a supplement to a given publication; 
instead, the link between the two resources 
has to be grounded at a granular location in the 
text --- which is to say, at a specific point in the 
document structure.  With this information, the 
publication viewer can add the visual cues and 
user actions to access the supplemental content 
--- for example, hyprrefs, buttons, or context menu 
options --- at the document locations which are 
most convenient for the reader.
}

\p{This specific example --- embedding visual cues and 
user actions within publications, so that readers 
can conveniently launch external software to view 
supplemental multimedia files --- demonstrates 
the interrelationship between application plugins 
and the Document Object Model, although there 
are many kinds of possible inter-operation between 
publication viewers and scientific or multimedia 
applications (loading individual multimedia resources 
is just one use-case).  The remainder of this paper 
will outline several different scenarios where 
inter-application networking is important for 
composing and reading manuscrips.  To provide a
quick summary of \LXCR{} overall, however, note that 
(despite the operational relationships between 
\DOM{} and plugin frameworks) currently there does 
not exist a standard model for combining plugins and 
\DOM{}s into a unified protocol.  \lLXCR{} therefore 
represents a novel paradigm which specifically 
addresses the implementational challenges of  
contemporary publishing technology    
}

\noindent\lun{The LTXH Plugin Framework (\lsLPF{})}
{\sectsp}  
\p{The goal of \LPF{} is to define a standard protocol 
for extending software applications so that they 
may be used in conjunction with software for viewing 
and composing publications.  In an educational context, 
\LPF{} plugins can augment scientific and 
technical applications with features that enhance 
their usefulness as teaching materials.  
\lLPF{} plugins can integrate desktop applications 
with course curricula, educational materials, 
and cloud services hosting student, instructor, 
and course information.   In general, 
\LPF{} refers not to a single plugin but rather a 
framework for creating plugins tailored 
to individual publishers, academic institutions, 
or educational software packages.  A given 
scientific or technical application may 
host multiple \LPF{} plugins, each tracking 
information structured according to the requirements 
of the plugin provider.}

\p{For sake of discussion, this paper will 
describe \LPF{} in terms of hypothetical 
ETS plugins developed expressly for Educational 
Testing Service.  To make the discussion more concrete, 
the paper will consider hypothetical ETS plugins for 
IQmol (a molecular visualization application), 
ParaView (data analysis and visualization software 
focused on statistical/quantitative data sets), 
MeshLab (a \ThreeD{} graphics engine), 
Octave (an open-source Matlab emulator),  
\Qt{} Creator (a \Cpp{} Integrated Development 
Environment), and XPDF (a \PDF{} viewer).}

\p{A suite of inter-related \LPF{} plugins 
--- for example, an ETS plugin suite --- would contribute 
two kinds of functionality to their host 
applications: (1) tracking and presenting 
information specific to individual students, courses, 
and instructors; and (2) allowing multiple applications 
which each have ETS plugins to interoperate.  
To explain the features of the plugin suite, consider 
the following scenarios: 

\begin{mldescription}%[itemsep=50pt]
%\setlength{\itemsep}{50pt}
\mlitem[%\parbox{14cm}{
Scenario 1: A student reads textbooks, articles, 
or test-preparation materials which may be enhanced 
with multimedia content%}
]  To augment the reading 
experience, educational texts may be supplemented 
with files describing visual, interactive materials 
which require specialized software.  For example, 
texts about chemistry (e.g., study materials for 
the chemistry \GRE{} exams) may include \ThreeD{} 
models of chemical compouns which can be viewed 
with IQmol; biology texts may be illustrated 
with \ThreeD{} tissue models which can be viewed 
in MeshLab; physics texts may describe 
equations or empirical data which may be visualized 
via ParaView, or Matlab simulations that could be 
executed through Octave.  Publications could then 
embed these supplemental 
materials directly, or else include links from which 
the multimedia files may be downloaded.  If the 
documents are viewed with an e-reader which itself 
hosts an ETS plugin --- take XPDF as a case-study --- 
then the viewer would identify the locations in the 
text where the multimedia files are relevant and, 
when the student is reading that part of the text, 
notify him or her of the option to automatically 
launch the proper application with which to access the content.

\pseudoIndent{} A hypothetical XPDF plugin, for example, 
would identify the correct application to use to view 
multimedia content based on the file type.  This feature 
could also be refined via a cloud service --- information 
provided by instructors could include notation of the 
kinds of software used for any particular course.  
This cloud-hosted data might, for instance, indicate 
that a specific course is using IQmol as a pedagogical 
tool, and indicate that cheminformatic files linked 
to teaching materials for the course should always be 
viewed with IQmol.  Once the XPDF plugin identifies 
the proper multimedia software to use, it can 
lanch the application on the student's computer and 
--- assuming the target application also has an ETS 
plugin --- send that application signals identifying 
which files to load into the application session.   
The XPDF plugin may also send 
information about the current student and 
class/curriculum, which the target application may use to 
personalize the User Interface according to students' 
or instructors' preferances (see the next scenario 
for more about personalization).

\pseudoIndent{} For multimedia content which is 
not specific to specialized technical softwar 
--- that is, generic multimedia formats such as 
audio, video, or panoramic-photography --- 
\LPF{} plugins for PDF or ePub viewers can present 
this content directly, in separate windows detached 
from the principle document viewer, rather than 
routing the files to external software.   

\mlitem[Scenario 2: Authors or instructors 
analyze publications' content to develop teaching 
materials]  When documents are read in an 
educational context, they become part of a 
larger ecosystem that extends beyond publication 
itself --- an ecosystem of assessment, test preparation, 
curricular design, and overall teaching environments 
(labs, classrooms, and so forth).  This superimposes 
additional criteria on publications: why is a given 
reading assignment included in a course curriculum?  
How can students' understanding of the reading be 
tested?  How can the publication be used in the 
context of the actual pedagogical environment where 
students are active (in labs with specific 
equipment and software, for example)?  How can 
instructors use or compose supplemental material to 
help students master the primary texts 
--- explanatory reviews, for instance, but also 
visualization tools, glossaries, additional readings, 
and other resources which promote students' intuitive 
understanding of the subject material?    

\pseudoIndent{} These are questions which become 
relevant for any document which is used in an 
instructional context --- including but not limited 
to publications originally created for 
educational use (such as textbooks or test-preparation 
materials).  Such use-cases illustrate the value of 
machine-readable Document Object Models which provide 
structured access to publication content, as opposed 
to the merely visual access offered by \PDF{} files.  
Pedagogically using publications can involve extracting 
information from texts, or laying on additional 
content: inserting review questions at strategic 
points in the text; compiling glossaries indicating 
when technical terms are first used; foregrounding 
graphics and figure illustrations and encouraging 
students to explore them in depth 
(for instance, performing for themselves the calculations 
which are plotted in a statistical diagram; or 
identifying the axes, scales of measurement, dimensions, 
free and dependent parameters, and other mathematical 
details of a quantitative illustration).  Both of 
these kinds of operations --- extracting or adding 
content --- require computational access to a 
Document Object Model.    
 
\pseudoIndent{} These use-cases reveal the limitations of 
presenting digital manuscripts solely in \PDF{} (or 
e-Pub or \HTML{}) formats --- in general it is difficult or 
impossible to pull information from these formats analogous 
to how algorithms may traverse an \XML{} \DOM{}.  For 
this reason, certain publishers and electronic journals offer 
machine-readable views on their publications as supplements 
to the human-readable \PDF{} files; however, this practice 
is not widely adopted in educational settings.  Also, 
many publishers use \XML{} as an internal representation 
for the publishing workflow (editing, typesetting, compositing, 
etc., often through legacy software originally implemented 
for \SGML{}); however, those in-house files are 
not usually made available to the public (even purchasers or 
subscribers who have digital rights to the final publication).  
This situation explains the importance of a 
multi-format Document Object Model: by publishing 
machine-readable infosets capturing the content of 
human-readable manuscripts, as supplemental materials 
to manuscripts themselves, it is easier for 
educational technology to integrate publications 
into a digital learning platform.      

\pseudoIndent{} Computer code which operates on 
\LXCR{} Document Object Models can therefore act 
in consort with \LPF{} plugins.  For example, an 
\LDOM{} component could define review questions 
or glossary definitions linked to specific points 
in the text; this supplemental content may then 
be packaged along with the original publication.  
With suitable \LPF{} plugins, the document viewer 
can then process the review material and 
superimpose pedagogical questions, comments, or instructions 
on the underlying document text.     

\mlitem[Scenario 3: A student launches a scientific 
application which is used as a pedagogical tool]  
Teachers often instruct students to download 
and install software relevant to course curriculum, 
and this software can potentially be an essential 
part of the course content.  Instructors may 
(1) use the visualization capabilities of these 
domain-specific applications to help students 
understand the concepts covered in class; 
(2) provide instruction in how to use the 
software as part of the curriculum; 
(3) evaluate students' understanding of the 
software as part of their assessment of 
students' mastery of the curriculum; or 
(4) use applications' analytic features as an 
overview of analytic or quantitative methodologies 
relevant to the course's subject matter.  In 
the case of IQmol, features such as 
energy minimization, plotting orbitals, 
calculating vibrational frequencies, and many 
other chemphysical computations provide an 
overview of scientific concepts which 
might be covered in a Chemistry class. 
 
\pseudoIndent{} To facilitate the 
use of scientific applications as teaching tools, 
\LPF{} plugins help instructors personalize the 
applications which their students use in 
conjunction with course curricula.  This personalization 
can have several dimenions, including: 
(1) manipulating the User Interface to prioritize 
concepts pertinent to each course; (2) 
enabling the application to present 
course-specific instructions to the student, 
such as instructions and assignments; 
(3) tracking a suite of resources curated 
for the specific class; and potentially (4) 
allowing students to send questions to the 
instructor with screenshots and application-state 
information.  Again using IQmol as a case-study,  
an ETS plugin could show students a list of molecular 
examples discussed in class (based on data 
provided by the instructor) and allow students 
to view the corresponding \ThreeD{} molecular 
graphics accordingly; instructors could also 
rearrange the IQmol menus and toolbars, to foreground 
those analytic tasks which are relevant to the 
course curriculum.  

\mlitem[Scenario 4: A student launches an Integrated Development 
Environment (\IDE{}) which is used as a teaching tool]  
Using \IDE{}s is a prerequite for most courses 
in computer science and computer programming, and 
in this context \LPF{} plugins may be used 
as with other specialized software.  An ETS 
plugin for \Qt{} Creator, for example, could 
load source and project files curated for 
individual classes, and display instructions 
or assignments for students based on instructor 
input.  The use-cases for \IDE{} plugins, however, 
extend beyond computer science proper, and include 
any scenario where students would write computer 
code as a learning aid or part of an assignment.  
Physics students might write algorithms 
to approximate answers to equations which lack  
closed-form solutions; biology students might 
write code to examine genetic patterns; 
chemistry students might develop simulations 
of materials' behavior in different force 
fields.  In these situations \LPF{} 
plugins would allow students to get information 
from instructors, within the \IDE{} itself, 
about the goals and requirements for a 
code-writing exercise. 

\pseudoIndent{} A further use-case for \IDE{} 
plugins is for building other \LPF{}-enabled 
applications.  For example, many scientific 
applications can be built from source on 
students' computers, with the aid of 
\IDE{}s such as \Qt{} Creator.  In these 
cases instructors can provide students 
with application code, perhaps modified 
according to the course curriculum 
(including with their own \LPF{} plugins).   
For example, \Qt{}-based applications such 
as IQmol, MeshLab, and XPDF can be built 
directly from \Qt{} Creator.  An 
ETS plugin for \Qt{} Creator could then be 
the first tool which students use at the 
start of a course, with that plugin obtaining 
information from a Cloud service about which 
applications are needed for the course.  
Behind-the-scenes tasks such as defining
project files and setting up build environments 
can then be performed automatically via the 
plugin, helping ensure that the student's 
system has the necessary prerequisites to 
run all the course-related software. 

\mlitem[Scenario 5: Authors Develop Educational 
Materials Targeting Specific Applications]
In this scenario, authors compose books, articles, 
or test-preparation materials with the anticipation 
that readers will use specific software applications to 
enhance their reading experience.  This sort 
of interrelationship between publications and external 
software is presupposed at a rudimentary level 
as soon as authors link documents to specialized 
multimedia files.  For example, files in the 
ParaView Data (\PVD{}) format are intended to be 
used by the ParaView software; as a result, documents 
which reference such files presuppose that readers 
will have ParaView installed on their computer, for 
the full reading experience.  Similarly, files 
in cheminformatic formats such as Protein data bank 
(.pdb) or Chemical markup language (.cml) need to 
be opened with chemistry-related software such 
as IQmol.  
  
\pseudoIndent{} In some cases, however, authors may 
desire a more rigorous degree of interop between 
document viewers and scientific/multimedia software.  
This situation applies when it is useful for readers not 
view particular multimedia files in domain-specific 
applications, but for the applications to be 
reconfigured so as to emphasize features or 
capabilities relevant to the publication which readers 
are studying.  Applications may temporarily modify their 
layout or appearance for reasons similar to those 
identified for Scenario 2: instructors may wish to foreground 
certain kinds of analyses which are pertinent to 
course curricula, or to group together files which 
are interrelated in the context of the course 
(e.g., based on study requirements for an upcoming 
class session).  Similar use-cases apply to 
publications which interoperate with domain-specific 
software.  The difference between the current scenario 
and the earlier use-cases is that Scenario 2 assumed 
that domain-specific applications will receive data 
from a cloud service, curated by instructors, 
to personalize their appearance and features 
for each course.  By contrast, the current 
scenario assumes that similar customization 
data is provided by publications themselves.  
Therefore, authors can personalize the 
software which enhances the reading experience, 
similar to how instructors may customize 
domain-specific software for each course.    
    
\pseudoIndent{} Although it is not a prerequisite 
for \LPF{} plugins, one tool which can help 
authors customize their audience's reading 
experience is the Hypergraph Text Encoding 
Protocol (\HTXN{}), formulated in conjunction with 
\LPF{}.  \lHTXN{} explicitly supports information 
sharing between document viewers and 
external software, such as scientific/multimedia 
applications.  While the \q{signals} routed 
via \HTXN{} between applications may simply be 
instructions to load and display a single file, 
they may also be more complex data structures 
which describe how the target application should 
adopt to the pedagogical role of presenting 
multimedia or technical content specifically 
linked to a publication which the current user is reading.  
\lHTXN{} is discussed in greater detail below.
 
\pseudoIndent{} Note also that \q{external software} 
referenced by a publication may actually be 
a unique application developed specifically 
for that document.  Examples of this scenario include 
publications which are paired with open-access 
data sets, when the data sets themselves include 
code for accessing and analyzing the published 
data.  Contemporary standards, such as the 
\q{Research Object} format, encourage authors not 
only to share raw data but to develop 
code libraries which help readers verify 
research findings.  These project-specific 
code libraries, particularly if they include 
\GUI{} components, can therefore play the role 
of multimedia applications which augment 
the reading experience, enhancing the 
publications which present research findings 
in a more conventional, less interactive fashion.

\noindent\lun{The Proposed ETS Plugin Framework}
{\sectsp}

\p{As proposed, the ETS Plugin Framework would create 
a common code base that can be used to 
implement ETS-specific plugins to 
applications spanning a range of academic 
disciplines and subject areas.  The primary 
goal of these plugins would be to connect 
e-reader software --- applications 
for viewing test-preparation and course 
materials --- with domain-specific software 
which instructors may use as teaching aids.  
With respect to GRE exams in fields 
such as biology, chemistry, or physics, 
domain-specific applications might include 
bioinformatics, molecular visualization, 
or physical simulation tools, respectively.  
ETS plugins would help scientific applications 
become more valuable as classroom tools.  In 
particular, with ETS plugins these applications 
can (1) receive signals from document viewers 
(such as PDF viewers) to automatically display 
multimedia content and (2) display course 
and instructional materials.  As a 
concrete example, consider molecularal 
visualization software such as IQmol.  Via 
an ETS plugin, IQmol could (1) render a \ThreeD{} 
image given data, in a chemical file format, 
received from an e-reader with a similar plugin; 
and (2) display instructions, questions, 
assignments, or course-related content 
(such as graphics for chemical compounds discussed 
in class) provided by instructors.}

\mnote{ETS\\ Plugin \\Cloud \\Services}
\p{Supplementing the functionality described in the 
preceding paragraph, Cloud Services can be 
used to connect individual applications 
to content and curricula specific to individual 
courses.  Because most scientific applications 
are implemented as desktop software, the hosting 
of the cloud back-ends to support these features 
would be a natural fit for LTS's \q{Native Cloud/Native} 
(NCN) protocol, which is specifically designed 
to integrate desktop front-ends with Cloud/Native 
services.  According to this architecture, 
NCN services would host information specific to 
individual courses, students, and instructors.  
When a student launches an application with an 
ETS plugin, the plugin would retrieve data 
pertaining to that student and to his or her classes.  
As appropriate, the plugin could then instruct the 
host application to load specific content, and/or 
present questions or instructions supplied 
by the instructor.  For example, IQmol could 
load a list of molecular files corresponding to 
chemicals studied in the students' class.  
The ETS Plugin Cloud back-end would also be 
used by document (e.g., PDF) viewers to obtain 
information needed to properly route signals 
to other applications using ETS Plugins.}

\mnote{Student \\Dash-\\board}
\p{In addition, one feature which should be common to all ETS 
Plugins is a \q{dashboard}, or a separate window 
aggregating the student's information.  The 
dashboard's design would be roughly as follows: 
student information would be divided into 
four or perhaps five tabs, with labels such 
as \q{My Courses}, \q{My Library}, 
perhaps \q{My Tests}, \q{My Applications}, and 
\q{My Account}.  Under the Courses tab, 
students select one course to focus on, 
which would cause the Library and Tests 
tabs to prioritize tests, test preparation, and 
readings assigned for that course.  Under 
the Applications tab, students could see 
a list of all applications on their computer 
which have the ETS Plugin installed, or 
which are used as pedagogical tools for their 
courses, or which they are instructed to install 
(the plugin could identify required software 
which students have not yet installed based 
on information provided by the ETS Cloud Service).}

\vspace{2em}
\noindent\lun{The \lsHTXN{} Protocol}
{\sectsp}

\p{\lHTXN{} is a new format and protocol for 
representing publications.  The central goal 
of \HTXN{} is to support a new generation of 
publishing technologies, where conventional 
document formats are increasingly being supplanted 
by digital, multimedia reader experiences.  
In the contemporary publishing paradigm, 
individual publications are often linked 
with other forms of digital content: multimedia 
resources, research data sets, machine-readable 
representations of document text, and 
domain-specific sofware applications 
(used to study or visualize the case-studies or 
research findings discussed in publications).  
The conventional manuscript (the \q{primary} 
resource which is cited and downloaded) 
is then networked with a package of 
supplemental (or \q{secondary}) resources.  
The \HTXN{} protocol is designed to 
rigorously document these multimedia networks, enabling 
e-readers and domain-specific applications to be 
integrated so that readers may easily access and 
experience multimedia content.}

\p{The generic term \q{multimedia content} actually 
encompasses multiple phenomena:

\vspace{-1em}
\begin{description}[leftmargin=2pt,
	labelindent=-2pt,labelsep=12pt]
\item[Multimedia Files]  Individual 
files representing audio, video, or 3D graphics content.  
These files may be linked from specific locations in 
the primary manuscript, or even embedded within manuscripts 
when they are published in \PDF{} format.
 
\item[Data Sets and Data Visualization]  Publishers 
increasingly emphasize sharing research data alongside 
texts, so readers can verify or even attempt to 
replicate claimed results.  Data sets are also a form 
of multimedia content because, apart from being aggregates 
of raw data, data sets are almost always accompanied 
by interactive, visual content: charts, diagrams, or 
plots to visualize the information holistically, or 
interactive tools to examine or navigate through the 
data set at finer scales.  

\item[Application Networks]  Another genre of multimedia 
content involves resources which may only be experienced 
through specialized software.  This classification encompasses 
content from particular scientific or technical domains, 
which is encoded in domain-specific formats: representations 
of molecular structures, archaeological sites, image-processing 
data, wave-forms for signal processing, sentence-parses for 
linguistic analysis, and so forth.  To conveniently access 
this kind of multimedia, readers need to use software 
which can send signals to the specialized applications 
having the capability to recognize the domain-specific 
formats and translate them to interactive, 
visual presentations.  In short, publication viewers 
(e.g., e-readers) need to participate in multi-application 
networks, where data can be sent and received between 
each component.  Publishers can provide this 
functionality to readers by implementing special 
e-readers and, in addition, writing plugins 
(or collaborating with external application developers) 
to ensure that applications networked with e-readers 
are properly aligned with the e-readers themselves.

\item[Publications-as-Applications]  In some 
cases, publications themselves are a form of 
multi-layered multimedia content.  This applies 
to publications which are not simply read from 
start to end, but instead naturally lend 
themselves to a reading process which navigates 
back and forth between different sections of 
the text, or juxtaposes different sections to be 
visible at the same time.  A canonical example 
of such layered reading is testing materials 
and test preparation, where exam questions, 
instructions, supplemental materials (such 
as passages for reading-comprehension 
assessment), and comments or analyses about 
answers (in the case of prep materials), 
each form different layers which 
students may wish to view side-by-side.  
In these cases, e-readers cannot simply 
treat the publication as one single ePub 
or PDF file.  Instead, the manuscript needs 
to identify text segments which can be factored 
into different layers, and the e-reader 
needs to implement text-viewers which allow 
each layer to be viewed in separate windows, 
with readers able to juxtapose and position the 
windows as desired. 
\end{description}\vspace{-2em}
}


\p{\lHTXN{} represents publication manuscripts 
using structures which rigorously document 
publications' multimedia content and multi-application 
networking requirements.  This detailed 
multi-media support has several dimensions: 

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=2pt]
\inditem{} Defining points in the manuscript where 
multimedia files are linked or embedded: this 
involves annotating locations in the manuscript 
with hyper-references to multimedia files 
(audio, video, etc.) which readers should be 
able to access when they reach the corresponding 
point in the text.

\inditem{} Establishing granular cross-references between 
publications and multimedia content: this is a 
more complex case where manuscript locations have to 
link \textit{to} or \textit{from} limited 
\textit{portions} of the corresponding multimedia 
resources.  For example, a passage in the manuscript 
may discuss a single sample within a data set; or 
may explicate a particular facet of the data set, 
such as an individual column in a tabular 
information space, or a specific set of 
statistical parameters against which quantitative 
operations are performed.  These scenarios 
call for bi-directional cross-references between the 
data set and the publication, wherein the granular 
data-set facet topically relevant to the 
corresponding manuscript location (the sample, 
table-column, parameters, etc.) is formally 
isolated and declared as a reference-target.  

\inditem{} Cross-referances may also be 
defined between publications' non-textual or 
non-paragraph content and corresponding 
multimedia resources.  For example, tables 
or diagrams visually presented in a manuscript 
may be liked to statistical data from which 
the figures are derived.  A similar situation 
applies when visuals inluded in a publication 
are linked to multimedia resources which 
represent the same information in a different 
experiential register: a PDF document may 
include a two-dimensional graphic which is created 
by taking a camera shot of a \ThreeD{} model, 
which readers may also experience with a 
\ThreeD{} graphics engine; or a publication may 
reproduce a graph or scatter-plot derived 
from a data set, where data visualization 
software can represent the same information 
in a more interactive medium, with parameters 
plotted as curves or surfaces in a \ThreeD{} 
ambient space, or where systems are visualized 
as systems evolving over time.  
\end{enumerate}
