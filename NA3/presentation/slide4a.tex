\item[Windows MFC] (~\$135b market size) A3R can be implemented 
in C++/CLI, building off of a generic-C++ version using 
the C++ Standard Library in place of Qt-specific data structures. 
\item[Apple XCode] (~\$25b market size) Apple Operating Systems 
are based on Linux, so a Linux-oriented A3R implementation can 
form the basis of an XCode version.  This XCode implementation 
would also be built around the C++ Standard Library. 
\item[JavaFX] (~\$12.5b market size)  The Java programming 
language provides the most widely used cross-platform 
application development framework outside of Qt.  
It is feasible to port C++ A3R implementations 
to Java.  The core of this re-implementation would 
involve designing a Java Hypergraph Library compatible 
with the A3R serialization and Interface Definition 
protocol.
\item[Workflow Management] (~\$10b market size) 
A3R plugins can be added to new or existing 
applications to support inter-application 
networking, allowing multiple applications to 
be unified into workflow- management systems.
