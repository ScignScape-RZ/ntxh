%\textit{US \$57 Million annual revenue} (source: Qt)
Financial records released by the Qt company suggest that commercial 
\q{Developer} and \q{Distribution} licenses 
are Qt's largest revenues source (targets 
released in 2018 indicate that Qt  
aims for 60\% revenue from licenses, 20\% from 
consulting, and 20\% for \q{support and maintenance}; 
total net revenue across these sources from 2018, 
the most recent figures available, was 
%\euro{}45.6 Million, just over 
US \$57 Million at 2018 rates).

\dmitem \textbf{ICS (Integrated Computer Solutions)} 
\textit{US \$25-50 Million annual revenue} (source: Glassdoor)
ICS specializes in custom software development 
for companies in the military, aeronautics, and 
biomedical sectors.  ICS exemplifies a 
Qt company whose revenue derives mostly from 
customization and consultation.

\dmitem \textbf{Toradex} 
\textit{US \$16.2 Million annual revenue} (source: owler.com)
Toradex specializes in microprocessors 
and embedded systems, one of the largest 
of several Qt partners focusing on 
embedded systems with Qt front-ends 
for touchscreens or desktop consoles 
monitoring cyber-physical networks.
