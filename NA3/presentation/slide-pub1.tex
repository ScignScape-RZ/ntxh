\doubleFrame{A3R applications may include viewers for 
popular document formats such as e-Pub, HTML, and PDF.  
The application may then supplement conventional publications 
with special software components, perhaps customized for 
individual manuscripts --- in this example, a widget 
allowing readers to visually explore patterns in 
classical Indian music.}
