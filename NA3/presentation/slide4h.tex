\dmitem \textbf{Scientific Computing} \hspace{.5em} 
NCN can provide a canonical framework for 
implementing cloud back-ends to augment 
the capabilities of technical/scientific 
desktop software.

\dmitem \textbf{Bioinformatics and Pharmacology}  \hspace{.5em} 
With a software-development environment 
combining powerful GUI development with 
rigorous data modeling, NA3 streamlines 
the implementation of complex applications 
managing multi-faceted data structures 
at both the analytic and User Interface 
level.  For example, biomedical/bio- pharmeceutical 
software typically integrates 
clinical, chemical, demographic, epidemiological, 
and imaging/radiological data into a unified 
platform.

\dmitem \textbf{Civil and Industrial Engineering and 
Educational Software}  \hspace{.5em} 
NA3 can augment engineering, educational, and 
industrial-design applications with cloud back-end 
services, with inter-application 
networking/workflow capabilities; and with 
multi-media publication viewers, for 
a richer reading experience of documents 
describing engineering or industrial 
designs and artifacts, as well as of 
instructional and test-preparation 
materials in an educational context 
(see slides 16-20 and 28-31).

\vspace{16pt}
\dmitem \textbf{Cyber-Physical Systems}  \hspace{.5em} 
NA3 can be used to implement rich-client monitoring 
software paired to cloud services hosting 
realtime IoT data.

\vspace{16pt}
\dmitem \textbf{E-Commerce/Real Estate}  \hspace{.5em} 
NA3 can help developers implement 
rich-client front-ends (as 
alternatives to web applications) for sectors such 
as e-commerce and real estate (see slides 21-27 
for capabilities uniquely available to native front-ends).
