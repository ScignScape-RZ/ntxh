\doubleFrame{... Once the 3D tissue sample is constructed by 3DimViewer's algorithms, 
an A3R inter-application networking protocol (implemented 
as an extension to both applications) allows 3DimViewer to 
export the model to MeshLab so that it may be studied in a 
more comprehensive 3D viewing environment.}
