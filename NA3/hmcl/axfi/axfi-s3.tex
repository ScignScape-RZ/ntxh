\section{AXFI Object Libraries and Serialization}

\p{\lAXFI{} is designed around the premise that the 
primary goal of any data modeling system (and, as a 
surface-level encoding of data to be shared, 
any markup language) is to encapsulate data 
which is used by and present in one application, 
to be subsequently used by a different 
application --- or the same application at a future 
time.
