\section{Overview}
\p{In recent years --- as publishing has become more \q{digitized} --- 
many online platforms have emerged for scientists to share and publish
their research work, including both raw data and scientific papers.
These portals generally provide an index/search feature where readers
can locate research based on the name of the author, title of 
the publication, keywords, or subject matter, along with a document 
viewer where readers can view the abstract of each 
publication (and sometimes full text of the article) and other
publication details (such as co-authors, date of 
publication, bibliographic references, etc.).
However, these portals offer only limited features for interactively
exploring publications, particularly when it comes to examining data
sets and/or browsing multimedia assets associated with publications,
such as audio, video, interactive diagrams, or \ThreeD{} graphics.}

\p{The \q{\MOSAIC{}} system 
(\q{Multi-Paradigm 
Ontologies for Scientific and Technical Publications}) 
is a suite of code libraries developed by LTS allowing 
institutions to host publication repositories 
free of the limitations of existing scientific document portals. 
With \MOSAIC{}, each publication can be
linked to a \text{supplemental archive} which contains information about
the author's research methods, data sets, and focal topics.  If desired, 
these archives can include machine-readable representations of 
full publication text, to support advanced text-mining techniques 
across the repository.}

\p{Using \MOSAIC{}, developers can implement a hosting platform
for this supplemental material, in addition to the publications 
themselves, where the platform provides software
enabling readers to browse and access supplemental archives and 
their data sets and/or methodological descriptions.  A \MOSAIC{} 
publication repository, also called a \MOSAIC{} \q{portal,} 
is a structured collection of data and documents which can be 
hosted via web servers (including fully encapsulated and 
containerizable cloud services) implemented with the help of 
\MOSAIC{} libraries.}

\p{\lMOSAIC{} repositories can serve as general-purpose portals, 
hosting academic papers covering a broad range 
of topics.  Alternatively, \MOSAIC{} repositories 
can serve as targeted portals hosting papers focused 
on more narrowly focused subject domains.  
Organizations can utilize \MOSAIC{} internally as the 
basis of a private document management system (\DMS{}), or 
to provide (public) open access to 
complete publications, including human-readable and machine-readable 
full text and all supplemental content, with no restrictions\footnote{
Excepting sensitive/private information which might be provided via 
a dedicated component within the portal with specific features 
for authors, editors, and administrators.  
Any project which \textit{does} restrict 
access to some part of any document requires a commercial 
\MOSAIC{} license.}.  \lMOSAIC{} can be customized 
for different subject areas by incorporating domain-specific 
ontologies into document-search features as well as 
machine-readable document-text annotations.}

\p{\lMOSAIC{} is designed so that the software to access 
publications and publications' supplemental archives can be embedded in 
scientific-computing applications via \MOSAIC{} \textit{plugins}.  
This ensures that publications and data sets can be 
examined interactively with the same software that scientists 
employ to conduct research.  \lMOSAIC{} also introduces a 
\textit{structured reporting system} (\MOSAICSR{}) for describing 
research/experimental/lab methods/protocols.  Supplemental archives, 
plugins, and the structured reporting system 
are outlined below.}

\part{MOSAIC Components}
\section{Supplemental Archives} 
\p{\lMOSAIC{} supplemental archives are additional resources 
paired with \MOSAIC{} publications.  In general, supplemental archives 
may include raw data, descriptions of research methods, 
or annotated data linked to publication texts.  Each supplemental archive 
could have any of the following resources:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Interactive versions of the publication, with annotations
indicating important concepts and phrases, perhaps aggregated into a
\q{glossary} defining technical terms;

\item Machine-readable representations of document texts, with 
special-purpose character encodings designed to facilitate 
Text and Data Mining (\TDM{});

\item Structured files containing raw data discussed in the publication,
along with interactive software allowing scientists to access and
reuse the data;

\item Detailed reports of the author's research methods and experimental
setup and/or protocols, conforming to the relevant standards with
respect to the publication's subject classification --- for instance,
the \q{Minimum Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations}
(\MIBBI{}) includes about 40 specific standards for different branches of
biology and medicine;

\item Representations of analytic methods and algorithms underlying 
the research findings, which are provided directly via computer code or
indirectly via formal descriptions of computational workflows;

\item Self-contained computer software which demonstrates code that the
author developed and/or used for analyzing/curating research data; and 

\item Multi-media assets such as audio or video files, annotated images,
\ThreeD{} graphics, interactive \TwoD/\ThreeD{} plots and diagrams, 
or other kinds of non-textual content which needs to be 
viewed with special multi-media software.

\end{enumerate}
}

\p{The contents of a supplemental archive will be different 
for different publications, depending on whether the archive 
contains specific raw data or just a summary of the methods 
used to obtain the raw data.  In the former case, a typical 
archive will include a \textit{data-set application}, or 
a semi-autonomous software component allowing 
researchers to study and visualize 
the data set, typically provided in turn via data files that are 
also located in the archive.  The data-set application will, in 
general, provide both a visual interface for raw data and code 
libraries for computationally manipulating this data; typically 
raw data files will encode serialized data structures that 
can be deserialized by code (e.g., \Cpp{} classes) included 
in the data-set application.  \lMOSAIC{} includes generic 
implementations of a data-set explorer (\q{\MdsX{}}), which 
can be adopted to the specific kind of information that needs 
to be serialized for a given publication.  As a result, 
data-set application can then be packaged as a plugin to 
existing scientific software within the 
relevant scientific discipline.}

\section{\protect\llMOSAIC{} Plugins}
\p{By design, \lMOSAIC{} Portals will provide a suite of plugins
for existing scientific software, allowing publications and
supplemental archives hosted on the portal to be read and examined
within computer software associated with each publication's subject
matter.  For example, articles about chemistry could be read within
\IQmol{}, a molecular visualization program; articles about cellular
biology and bioimaging could be read within \CaPTk{} 
(the Cancer Imaging and Phenomics Toolkit), an image-processing
application; articles discussing novel computer code could be read
within \Qt{} Creator, an Integrated Development Environment (\IDE{}) for
programming; etc.  The advantage of accessing 
a publication and a supplemental archive within actual scientific
software is that it allows research work to be understood, evaluated, 
and reused within the computing environments which scientists typically use to 
conduct professional research.  This is different 
than existing science publication portals, which 
generally rely on web browsers to
access supplemental materials like data sets and multimedia files ---
in this standard setup the software ecosystem wherein readers examine
published research is fundamentally separate from the software
platforms where research is actually conducted.  This example 
demonstrates how existing portals are \textit{limited} 
in their ability to share research
in rigorously reusable and replicable ways --- and how \MOSAIC{} 
offers an improvement.}

\p{Embedding presentations of their research within existing
scientific software has the added benefit for authors of making their work 
more practically and immediately useful for the scientific community.  
Such presentations establish the computational framework for pragmatically 
deploying their techniques in real-world scientific contexts, 
accelerating the pace at which research work can be translated to 
concrete scientific (and clinical/lab/experimental) practice.
As one example, research involving novel image analysis techniques 
could be packaged so as to target a \MOSAIC{} plugin for bioimaging
software such as \CaPTk{}, so that 
readers could actually run the author's code as a \CaPTk{} 
module.\footnote{This toolkit provides a good case-study for research 
publication because it has an innovative \Qt{} and Common Workflow 
Language based extension mechanism; cf. \bhref{https://cbica.github.io/CaPTk/tr_integration.html}.}  This is important because such 
functional assessment and adoption of novel contributions is harder to carry
out if a body of research work is described indirectly within article
text, as opposed to being concretely implemented within a
specific scientific application.}

\p{Another benefit of using plugins to 
access supplemental archives is that the host application will usually
provide more sophisticated multimedia and data visualization
capabilities, compared to static \PDF{} images or even interactive web
portals.  Publishers have begun to develop online platforms for
browsing research papers in conjunction with multimedia content such
as interactive diagrams and \ThreeD{} graphics --- a physical model of a
protein or a chemical compound, for instance, can be 
viewed online via \WebGL{};
such graphics could even be embedded as an \q{\textbf{iframe}} within an \HTML{}
version of the publications.  Publishers consider this to be
cutting-edge technology.  However, the same molecular \ThreeD{} model, when
viewed in \IQmol{}, can be enhanced with many additional visual features,
representing bonds, orbitals, torsion angles, etc.  The multimedia
experience of exploring chemistry data in custom software like \IQmol{} 
is therefore much greater than the experience of generic web
multimedia, which means that the scientific software is a better 
forum for showcasing novel research.}

\section{\protect\llMOSAIC{} Structured Reporting (\protect\lsMOSAICSR{})}

\p{The \MOSAIC{} structured reporting framework (\MOSAICSR{}) 
includes tools to help authors develop interactive 
presentations supplementing academic documents, and specifically 
to use supplemental archives to document how their research 
has been conducted.  With \MOSAICSR{}, authors can implement or 
reuse code libraries that report on 
research/experiment methods, workflows, and 
protocols.  The \MOSAICSR{} information may be structured 
as a \q{minimum information checklist} conformant 
to standards such as those collectively 
gathered into the \MIBBI{} recommendations;  
in this case \MOSAICSR{} would be applied by  
implementing object models instantiating \MIBBI{} 
policies.  Alternatively, \MOSAICSR{} reports can be 
derived from actual computer programs simulating 
research workflows, similar to \BioCoder{}\footnote{See 
\bhref{https://jbioleng.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1754-1611-4-13}.} (which is included by LTS, in an updated \Cpp{} version, as one 
\MOSAIC{} library).  Finally, \MOSAICSR{} presentations 
may be based on annotations applied to research/analytic 
code.  For example, in the context of image analysis, 
the \Pandore{} project (an image-processing application) 
provides an \q{Image Processing 
Objectives} Ontology as well as a suite of image-processing 
operations that can be called from computer code.  
Image-analysis pipelines can therefore be explained 
by annotating the pertinent function-calls 
(which \Pandore{} calls \q{operators}) with terms from 
the \Pandore{} controlled vocabulary, providing 
annotation targets for \MOSAICSR{} presentations.}

\p{\lMOSAICSR{} can express both computational 
workflows that are fully encapsulated by published 
code and real-world protocols concerning 
laboratory equipment and physical materials 
or samples under investigation.  In the latter 
guise, \MOSAICSR{} code can employ or instantiate 
standardized terminologies and data structures 
for describing experiments --- such as 
\MIBBI{} policies or \BioCoder{} functions.  
In this case, the role of \MOSAICSR{} code is 
to serve as a serialization/deserialization 
endpoint for sharing research metadata.  
Conversely, when workflows are fully implemented 
within software developed as part of a body 
of research, \MOSAICSR{} can provide a functional 
interface allowing this code to be embedded 
in scientific software.  For the latter,  
\MOSAICSR{} provides a framework for modeling 
how a software component specific to a given 
research project exposes its functionality to 
host and/or networked peer applications.  There 
are also instances where both scenarios are 
relevant --- the \MOSAICSR{} code would simultaneously 
document real-world experimental protocols and 
construct a digital interface as part of 
a workflow which is part digital (\q{\textit{in silico}}) and part 
\q{real-world} (\q{in the lab}).}

\section{\protect\llMOSAIC{} Annotations}
\p{Included in any \MOSAIC{} plugin would be specially-designed 
\PDF{} viewers for interactively 
reading authors' papers.  In particular, these \PDF{}
applications would recognize cross-references linking between 
publications and their associated supplemental archives.  This would
allow authors to identify concepts which are discussed and/or
represented both in the research paper and in the archive, annotating
their papers accordingly.  For example, 
the concept \q{\RNA{} Extraction} may be discussed in a
publication text, and also formally declared as one step in the lab
processing as represented via \BioCoder{}, summarized in a
\BioCoder{}-generated chart, and included in the supplemental archive 
(a similar example is used in the documentation for \BioCoder{}).
The \PDF{} viewer would then ensure that the phrase \q{\RNA{} Extraction} in
the text is interactively linked to the concordant step in the
experimental process, so that readers would then be able 
to view the \BioCoder{} summary as a context-menu action associated 
with the phrase where it appears in the \PDF{} file.  For a different 
example, the phrase \q{Oxygenated Airflow} refers to airflow in 
assisted-breathing devices, such as
ventilators; to ensure that the device is working properly, the
equipment must be monitored to check that a steady stream of oxygen
reaches the patient.  Research into the design and manufacturing of
ventilators and similar devices may then include \q{Oxygenated Airflow}
both as a phrase within the article text and as a parameter in data
sets evaluating the device's performance.  In this situation, the
publication-text location of the \q{Oxygenated Airflow} phrase should once
again be annotated with links to the relevant part of the data set
(e.g., a table column) where measurements of airflow levels are
recorded.}

\section{\protect\llMOSAIC{} in the context of Image Analysis}
\p{This section will focus on one specific application 
of \MOSAICSR{} in the context of image analysis 
and bioimaging --- specifically, what we term \DSPIN{} 
(\q{Data Structure 
Protocol for Image-Analysis Networking}).   
\lDSPIN{} adds a narrower focus by 
extending \MOSAICSR{}.  Software that uses the \DSPIN{} 
protocol is able to provide a description of image 
processing capabilities which have been 
utilized and/or are functionally exposed 
by code and data associated with a research 
project.  This includes \q{structured reporting} 
of research objectives as well as a concrete 
interface for invoking analyses associated 
with the relevant research (either new algorithms or 
techniques used to obtain reported findings).
\lDSPIN{}, in turn, is based on \CaPTk{} and 
\Pandore{} (which includes both data models and interactive 
software) and the \Pandore{} \q{Image Processing Objectives} 
Ontology, mentioned above.  
\DSPIN{} adopts protocols from \CaPTk{} 
in order to accept information about how different objectives 
are merged into workflows, particularly 
with respect to implementating 
image-analysis capabilities as 
extensions to a core application, and 
with respect to \CaPTk{}'s implementation of the 
Common Workflow Language (\CWL{}).  In effect, 
\DSPIN{} formalizes the data models and 
prototypes adopted by \Pandore{} and 
\CaPTk{} so as to concretize \MOSAICSR{} 
for the specific domain of image processing 
and Computer Vision.  The sections below 
will therefore outline \DSPIN{} features 
in the context of \MOSAICSR{} design principles 
and objectives.}

\section{Meta-Procedural Modeling in 
\protect\lsDSPIN{} and \protect\lsMOSAICSR{}}

\p{When developed as a systematic outline of 
computational workflows --- not just a digital 
summary of real-world (e.g. lab) protocols --- 
\MOSAICSR{} reports can be formalized 
using a \MOSAIC{} component which we call 
\q{Hypergraph Multi-Application Configuration 
Language} (\HMCL{}).  Most approaches to modeling research workflows 
involve some concept of \q{meta-objects},\footnote{See 
the \sVISSION{} system: \bhref{https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1ad7/c459dc4f89f87719af1d7a6f30e6f58dff17.pdf}.} 
\q{tools} (in the terminology of \CWL{}), 
or \q{transitions} (in the language of Petri Net 
theory).  In \HMCL{}, the equivalent concept is 
that of \textit{metaprocedures}, which are analogous 
to ordinary computational procedures but 
add extra sources of information concerning 
input and output parameters.  In general, 
rather than simply passing an input value 
into an executable routine, metaprocedures 
define steps which can be taken to 
acquire the proper values when needed.  
Aside from ordinary runtime values, the 
most important input sources are methods 
defined on \GUI{} components; command-line 
parameters; file contents; and 
not-yet-evaluated expressions (perhaps 
encapsulated in scripts or function pointers).  
A metaprocedure formulation abstracts the 
acquisition of input arguments (or the consumption of 
values within \q{channels} via which a procedure sends and 
receives data) 
from the concrete procedure or procedures 
which are eventually executed.  Therefore, 
an \HMCL{} metaprocedure definition 
has two separate parts: a preamble where 
input sources are described; and an 
executive sequence where concrete procedures 
are indicated.  A \textit{meta-evaluator} 
then operates in accord with these 
definitions, concretizing the input values 
and launching the actual procedure(s).  
For \DSPIN{}, metaprocedures can be defined 
using a framework based on \BioCoder{}, 
but adopted to the imaging and Computer Vision 
context.}

\p{Image analysis methods are often 
described in academic literature in 
terms of mathematical formulae and/or 
characterizations of computing environments 
(such as Graphical Processing Units). 
It requires additional construction to 
translate these overviews into actual 
computer code.  Once 
Computer Vision innovations are in fact 
concretely implemented, there is then 
an additional stage of development 
requisite for users to enact in practice  
the computations described in the 
research.  Although it is theoretically 
possible to demonstrate novel methods 
within fully self-contained autonomous 
applications, it is more convenient for 
users if research code is integrated 
with existing imaging software.  
Along these lines, the \DSPIN{} interface can help 
connect new code to existing applications, 
allowing users to access the new code's functionality 
through \GUI{} actions, command-line invocations, 
or inter-application messaging.}

\p{In addition to pragmatically enabling 
application embedding, \DSPIN{} models 
represent research methods and theories, 
contributing to transparency and 
reusability according to the 
\MIBBI{} and \FAIR{} (Findable, Accessible, 
Interoperable, Reusable) standards.\footnote{See 
\bhref{https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331775411_FAIRness_in_Biomedical_Data_Discovery}.}
This can be achieved, in part, by implementing 
data structures conforming to \Pandore{} 
Image Processing Objectives.  However, \DSPIN{} 
embeds this logic in an Object-Oriented 
context which allows imaging-specific workflow 
notations to be paired with specifications 
outside of image-processing in the narrowest 
sense.  This allows \DSPIN{} to be available 
for hybrid computational-objectives representations 
which are only partially covered by the imaging 
domain --- analogous to the \MIAPEGI{} 
(Gel Electrophoresis Informatics) component 
of \MIAPE{} (Minimum Information About a Proteomics 
Experiment).  The following section will 
discuss several domains where \DSPIN{} has 
been explicitly integrated with code 
libraries codifying \MIBBI{}-style research protocols.}

\section{\protect\lsDSPIN{} in Contexts Supplemental to Image Processing}
\vspace{2em}
\subsection{Image Flow Cytometry}
\p{One important use-case for biomedical image processing 
is to analyze cellular microscopy in conjunction with 
cytometric experiments which indirectly investigate cells and 
cellular-scale entities (such as proteins).  
Conceptually, image analysis and flow cytometry 
(\FCM{}) analysis 
are mathematically similar, and some commercial 
cytometry software has been extended with 
image-processing capabilities.  The overlap 
between cytometric and image analysis has also 
inspired attempts to merge cytometry standards, 
such as \MIFlowCyt{} (the Minimum Information about a Flow Cytometry Experiment policy within \MIBBI{}), with bioimaging 
standards such as \DICOM{} (Digital Imaging and 
Communications in Medicine).  One such proposal is 
due to Robert Leif, who argues that \q{The large overlap between imaging and flow cytometry provides strong evidence that both modalities should be covered by the same standard} 
and has formalized an \XML{} language 
(\CytometryML{}) to serve as that 
overarching bridge.\footnote{See 
\bhref{https://spie.org/Publications/Proceedings/Paper/10.1117/12.2295220?SSO=1}.}  The \DSPIN{} project builds 
off this work by introducing its own \FCM{}/\DICOM{} 
hybrid, although in an object-oriented rather 
than \XML{}-based context, although it also 
incoporates an expanded 
\XML{}-oriented schema (discussed in 
the next part of this paper).  As a reference implementation 
for this \DSPIN{} extension, the project 
also provides a pure-\Cpp{} cytometry 
library based on the \openCyto{} (see \bhref{https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/cytolib.html}) and 
\FACSanadu{} (see \bhref{https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/10/13/201897.full.pdf}) libraries, while eliminating 
external dependencies such as \R{} and 
\Java{}.\footnote{Upon request, LTS can provide 
a detailed summary of this project reconciling 
\sopenCyto{} and \sFACSanadu{}.  Specifically, 
although \sopenCyto{} as a whole uses \sR{} for its 
visual layer, \sopenCyto{} contains \scytoLib{}, a \sCpp{} 
library for cytometric analysis, which LTS employs 
as the basis for a standalone pure-\sCpp{} flow 
cytometry application.  Meanwhile, \sFACSanadu{} 
is a \sJava{} application which uses a \sQt{} front-end 
that LTS is migrating to \sCpp{}.  The supplemental 
information supplied by LTS about the \sFACSanadu{}/\scytoLib{} integration 
identifies the specific data types where \scytoLib{} 
code (different kinds of gates, for instances) can 
be incorporated as alternatives to the \sFACSanadu{} 
\sJava{} equivalents, while still using \sFACSanadu{} 
\sGUI{} classes.}  The \FCM{}/\DICOM{} bridge is 
implemented in this context via a 
\DSPIN{} supplement to \DICOM{} based 
on \q{Semantic \DICOM{},} which is an 
effort to standardize query processing 
within \PACS{} (Picture Archiving and 
Communications Service) workstations and 
to more effectively integrate \DICOM{} with 
clinical data.}

\subsection{A Semantic \protect\lsDICOM{} Object Model}

\p{As a formal representation of imaging workflows, 
\DSPIN{} would reasonably be paired in 
many contexts with \DICOM{}, insofar as \DICOM{} 
represents the canonical standard for exchanging 
medical image data.  For its applications within 
the medical-imaging context, \DSPIN{}, therefore, 
provides object-oriented accessors 
to \DICOM{} data such that image-objectives and 
\DICOM{} object models can interoperate.  
This object-oriented foundation also provides a 
basis on which to further integrate clinical 
data in the form of \q{Semantic} \PACS{} 
models.\footnote{See \bhref{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5119276/}.}  The original Semantic \PACS{} implementation 
draws clinical data from \DICOM{} headers, and 
represents this extracted information via \RDF{}.  
In keeping with \MOSAIC{}'s more object-oriented 
focus, the \MOSAIC{}-Semantic \DICOM{} (\MOSAICSD{}) 
integration is engineered instead as an 
extension to the \DICOM{} Toolkit (\DCMTK{}) 
library, though it imports many constructs 
within Semantic \DICOM{} in the guise 
of a \q{Hypergraph Ontology} --- one example of a 
system \MOSAIC{} uses to merge Semantic Web 
schema with Object-Oriented code.  In short, \MOSAICSD{} 
extends \DSPIN{} by defining  a central \DICOM{} object model 
affixed to both clinical and 
image-processing object models.}

\p{The \MOSAICSD{} object system applies 
not only to \DICOM{} integrated with 
statements of image-processing objectives, 
but also to other biomedical contexts where 
image analysis should be integrated 
with other analytic modalities as well as with clinical or 
epidemiological information.  For example, Flow 
Cytometry overlaps with clinical data tracking because 
one of \FCM{}'s essential investigative roles 
is to examine patients' immunological 
response to diseases and/or interventions.  
In the context of Covid-19, say --- with respect to 
achieving a deeper understanding of how 
and why SARS-CoV-2 symptoms present differently 
in different patients --- \q{The starting point will likely be a deep characterization of the immune system in patients with different stages of the disease.}\footnote{See \bhref{https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cyto.a.24002}.}  
That is, \FCM{} observations need to be 
matched with clinical data in order to 
classify (and consider statistical correlations 
between) immunological findings and clinical facts: 
risk factors, sociodemographics, disease 
progression, and so forth.  This analysis 
intrinsically assumes that \FCM{} data can 
be transparently linked with all relevant 
clinical data, but such integration is 
difficult even in \DICOM{}, where \DICOM{} 
headers are specifically designed for preserving 
patient data across picture-sharing networks  
(there is no analogous \q{header} 
component in the Flow Cytometry Standard, \FCS{}).  
In brief, \DSPIN{} extensions to 
non-imaging domains can promote 
data integration insofar as \DSPIN{} 
Clinical Object Models, based on 
Semantic \DICOM{}, provide 
an affixation point for clinical data 
in analytic contexts which are 
operationally related to image analysis, 
and not just to image analysis by itself.}

\subsection{Semantic \protect\lsDICOM{} via \protect\lsDCMTK{} Extensions}
\p{As a concrete example of how a Semantic \DICOM{} Object Model could be 
implemented, consider the process of developing \DICOM{} extensions 
by modifying existing \DICOM{} client libraries, such as 
\DCMTK{}.  As a file \textit{standard}, \DICOM{} itself is 
an abstraction; the \DICOM{} protocol only becomes a concrete 
phenomenon insofar as \PACS{} workstations, radiology software, 
and other applications employ \DICOM{} client libraries.  Therefore, 
any \DICOM{} \textit{extension} is similarly concretized only 
by an application which links against modified \DICOM{} libraries 
that recognize the extended syntax and/or semantics.  When implementing 
\DICOM{}, accordingly, we can assume that the modified client libraries 
exist in an ambient context which provides capabilities that can 
be leveraged by the extension as it becomes formalized.  For example, 
if a \DICOM{} extension provides a unified \FCM{}/\DICOM{} format, 
we can assume that the workstation linking against modified 
\DCMTK{} libraries supports \FCM{} features, such as the ability 
to construct geometric gating models (that is, rectangular or 
ellipsoid segments on \FCM{} images) and to consume information 
about the cytometric equipment used to 
derive the current \FCM{} data.}

\p{In the case of Semantic \DICOM{}, we can similarly 
assume that the host application which loads 
an enhanced \q{Semantic} version of a \DICOM{} client library 
has the ability to consume more complex clinical data models 
than are incorporated into conventional \DICOM{}.  In the 
case of \DCMTK{}, patient information is accessed through a 
\textbf{DcmDataset} object, which in turn contains multiple 
\textbf{DcmObject} values spanning several more specific 
types.  A \DICOM{} extension can, accordingly, be concretized by 
expanding the range of object types subsumed under \textbf{DcmObject}, 
as well as modifying the \textbf{DcmDataset} code so that 
instances of these extended types could be identified and 
passed off to the appropriate handlers.  Developers can then 
bundle files serializing these extended types within the 
overall collection of files zipped into a single 
\DICOM{} resource.}

\p{The steps outlined above allow an extension object model to 
be embedded in \DICOM{} by hooking extra processing code 
into the procedures whereby conventional \textbf{DcmDataset}s  
are extracted from \DICOM{} files.  It is then necessary to 
ensure that the \DICOM{} client application can properly 
manipulate the extension object data.  This could be handled 
simply by linking all necessary libraries into the \DICOM{} client 
itself, but a more flexible solution is to employ some 
form of multi-application networking.  In the case 
of non-standard clinical data, a flexible approach would be 
to pair client libraries for serializations of such data 
with a standalone application that can parse these 
serializations and respond to requests about the encoded 
information.  With such an application in place, the 
\DCMTK{} host application would not need to implement 
all logic related to the extension object model; it 
would simply need to be able to launch and/or communicate 
with a secondary application tailored to each individual extension 
in particular.}

\p{As a concrete example, consider a specialized data model and 
self-contained application specifically devoted to tracking 
immunological responses and post-recovery symptomology 
for Covid-19.  The goal would be to develop more sophisticated 
technology for modeling the progression of active Covid-19 
infections, as well as the lingering effects of the disease 
for patients who experience adverse reactions (such 
as lasting neurological damage or lung impairment) even after their 
ostensive recovery.  Detailed models of Covid-19 affliction could then 
be matched against epidemiological, treatment, and sociodemographic 
data to determine whether there are predictors that determine which 
patients may experience more severe or long-lasting symptoms, 
and whether these symptoms can be mitigated by different treatment 
options.  The data consumed by such a Covid-specific application 
might be bundled into \DICOM{} files even if \DICOM{} clients 
cannot directly process this data.  In such a case, they could, 
instead, be programmed to launch the Covid-specific application 
and query that application for select pieces of information 
that \textit{are} relevant for a \DICOM{} workstation 
(e.g., an immunological profile of the patient adding 
layers of detail to cytological imaging).  In short, 
a Covid-specific application would potentially be accessed by 
several different peer applications addressing 
several different biomedical domains (bioimaging, cytometry, 
epidemiology, genomics), and could provide different 
sorts of information from a Covid-specific data model 
for different contexts: given an overall information 
package about a patient's SARS-CoV-2 immunology and symptomology, 
some categories of data will be relevant for bioimaging, 
while others will be relevant for 
genomics and so forth.  The file formats employed by 
these various peer applications (such as \DICOM{}, in the 
bioimaging context) may then be extended only as much 
as is needed to seed shared data packages with enough 
information to launch the Covid-specific application and 
request information specific to the peer application's 
specific biomedical domain.}

\subsection{Geo-Imaging and Geographic Information Systems}
\p{Another area where \DSPIN{} provides structured 
object models is that of Geographic Information Systems 
(\GIS{}) annotations.  There is a direct link between image processing 
and \GIS{} insofar as identifying geotaggable 
features is one dimension or application of 
Computer Vision.  Effectively manipulating 
geoimaging data requires mathematical 
translations between several different 
coordinate systems, in both two and 
three dimensions.  These coordinate 
transforms --- as well as semantic interpretations 
of geoimage segments (buildings, land features, 
roads, etc.) --- can serve as the basis for 
an object model attaching image-processing 
objectives to \GIS{} workflows.}

\p{In conventional \GIS{} annotation, 
data structures are linked to both 
geospatial coordinates and to 
visual cues or icons  
allowing locations of interest to be 
indicated on maps.  The actual geotagged 
data structures could be derived from 
any domain; as such any object model 
may be integrated with \GIS{} annotations 
so long as one can assign spatial interpretations 
to the phenomena computationally encapsulated 
by the domain in question.  In a medical 
context, for instance, geotagged data 
might represent the scope of a vaccination campaign, 
or the extent of an epidemic, along with 
relevant geographic or civic features 
(villages, medical clinics, national borders, 
and so on).  The actual map as a visible 
digital artifact therefore serves as a 
virtual glue where clinical, geographical, 
governmental, and \GUI{} data are all 
sutured together.  Insofar as geoimaging 
involves analysis of photographed land 
features and/or urban environments, 
image processing information represents a 
further object model that can be 
added to the mix.  Even when dealing solely 
with virtual maps, however --- rather 
than with satellite images or other geospatial 
photography --- the analysis and application-level 
rendering of map features is sufficiently 
similar to image processing that a rigorous 
model of \GIS{} integration belongs 
properly within \DSPIN{}, specifically 
within a \MOSAICGIS{} extension.}

\vspace{-6pt}
\section{Hypergraph Database Models for Publication Data}
\p{At the core of any \MOSAIC{} portal is a collection of 
distinct files, representing individual publications and 
supplemental archives.  However, in a typical case it 
becomes necessary to ground the system of files in a 
database that hosts publication information, so that 
readers could search the portal for specific authors, 
keywords/phrases, titles, subject areas, and so forth.  
Searches within publication metadata are the simplest 
example of this functionality.  However, searches within publication 
texts themselves are more complex, because what seems like a 
straightforward keyword search from a user's point of 
view might be more complicated at the processing level by 
documents' markup structure.  That is, technical terms or acronyms 
which readers simply see as single words/phrases might be 
defined in a more complicated way within the document, 
such as by internally structured text 
segments rather than raw character streams.  In addition, 
keyword searches might also be tripped up by 
ligatures, footnote interruptions, and 
other visual features wherein the document in human-readable 
formats like \PDF{} markedly diverges  
from machine-readable raw text.}

\p{To address these potential search complications, \MOSAIC{} 
provides a \q{Hypergraph Text Encoding Protocol} (\HTXN{}) 
which effectively separates document text into different layers, 
dividing presentation-related content from textual content and 
making search capabilities more reliable.  Each publication can have 
an \HTXN{} representation, essentially a machine-readable structure 
encapsulating document text, as part of its supplemental archive.  
These \HTXN{} resources can then be used to support 
robust searching among text publication sets.}

\p{Apart from metadata and keyword searches within texts, \MOSAIC{} 
allows an additional layer of search functionality: the option to 
search across supplemental archive contents such as data sets 
and research protocol descriptions.  
\lMOSAIC{} provides a hypergraph-based database engine that 
can be used, at a minimum, for publication info; in 
addition, developers 
have the option of including supplemental content  
within this central database.  Each supplemental archive 
encompasses raw data and/or methodological descriptions 
via files internal to the archive; these assets are not 
necessarily shared with the host \MOSAIC{} repository 
database (except via operations that directly 
examine archive files).  However, those who create or 
maintain a repository could choose to model some or all archive 
content within its publication database, either directly storing 
archives' data sets or importing certain select information 
(such as object/type schema or representative data samples).  
In this case, some such data in the supplemental archives will be 
mirrored in the central database, so that it is accessible 
for user-facing searches.  To accommodate 
many different kinds of data models (from \q{\SQL{}-like} 
tables to graphs and hierarchical collections types) \lMOSAIC{} employs 
a flexible Hypergraph Database engine.  
Thus, the publication database within a \MOSAIC{} 
portal would have the flexibility to import most data 
which is present in supplemental content associated 
with given publications.} 

\p{In some contexts, however, authors are given the option to 
structure their shared research data in a format that 
can be exported to a \MOSAIC{} publication database.  
This is possible because \MOSAIC{}'s hypergraph data model 
supplies a rigorous framework for documenting how 
a data set is organized, which in turn can provide a 
formal overview of the theoretical or methodological 
commitments informing the research.  The \MOSAIC{} database 
engine --- called \ConceptsDB{} --- represents an expanded 
hypergraph metamodel built around different paradigms 
for expressing scientific knowledge, such as Conceptual 
Space Theory and Conceptual Role Semantics.\footnote{Or at least 
a variation of Conceptual Roles consistent with \AI{} tools 
such as \Grakenai{}, and formalizations of Conceptual 
Spaces such as those described in \bhref{https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06366}.}}

\section{Markup Serialization and \protect\q{Grounding} in 
\protect\lsMOSAIC{} Portals}
%\vspace{-1em}
\p{The data-integration mechanisms discussed up 
to now have focused on 
object models and object-oriented programming 
techniques.  It is understood that while composing 
special-purpose object-based libraries 
specifically tailored to individual  
data-integration problems is a powerful 
tool for solving such problems, data integration initiatives 
in practice are often organized around standards 
for sharing or serializing conformant 
data structures.  Therefore, an important 
aspect of data integration is implementing 
proper data-serialization technology 
that is sufficiently rigorous to 
serve as a \textit{proxy} for formal interface 
definitions.  \lXML{} formats present a good case-study 
for such formalizations because 
most serialization in 
the biomedical and bioimaging context 
operates through 
\XML{} languages.}

\p{Standardizing a data 
format by stipulating how \XML{} files 
may encode the data is much simpler than 
defining an analogous specification 
in terms of executable computer code: 
one way to document the shape of any 
relevant data is simply to explain how an \XML{} 
document will be structured insofar as 
it encodes data accordingly.  Potentially, 
such specification can be a single 
\XML{} \DTD{} file, or an \XML{} sample, 
providing a convenient reference point 
for developers to grasp the underlying 
data model.  However, the structure of an \XML{} document 
does not, in and of itself, present a clear picture of 
how the information which the document 
represents is semantically organized.  Even 
though \XML{} is processed by computer programs, 
one cannot even determine from an \XML{} document or 
schema which \XML{} elements (if any) correspond 
to data types recognized by applications which 
read and/or write the corresponding \XML{} code.  
For example, the \XML{} portion of \OMETIFF{} 
(the principal Open Microscopy Environment imaging 
format) includes an explicit \textbf{Image} element 
(which gathers up all significant image metadata); 
an application reading \OMETIFF{} files 
might, therefore, introduce a single datatype 
--- analogous to (and maybe wrapping an) \textbf{itk::Image} from 
the Insight Toolkit imaging libraries --- 
bundling the data in that part of the \OME{} \XML{}.  
In this case, there will be a one-to-one correspondence 
between \XML{} structure and application-level 
data types, at least for that one \textbf{Image} node.  
On the other hand, software reading \OMETIFF{} 
information might not manipulate images directly, 
but rather pull out other kinds of metadata, 
such as an experimenter's name or description 
of the microscopic setup.  In this case, 
the application might not have an explicit 
\q{object} representing the image itself, 
but it may still read information about the 
image from child nodes of the \XML{} \textbf{Image} 
element.}

\p{In short, because applications can read or use data 
from an \XML{} document in different ways, 
the document's structure does not itself 
provide a clear picture of how the specific code that 
reads the \XML{} is organized.  Such uncertainty 
becomes significant when one wishes to use 
\XML{} specifications as an indirect strategy 
for documenting parameters and features 
of the data structures which are serialized 
via the relevant \XML{} language.  In effect, 
\XML{} serialization operates on two levels: 
on the one hand, the specific \XML{} document 
provides an encoding of data conforming to a 
given structure; but, at a more abstract 
level, one can model the relationship 
between the surface-level \XML{} node 
structure and the application-level data structures 
thereby serialized.  This second level of detail 
is usually implicit and unstated, but in the \MOSAIC{} 
technology, such \q{meta-serialization} --- a term we are using 
to suggest the idea of providing meta-data 
\textit{about} a serialization --- is directly 
formulated through a notion of 
\q{grounding,} which involves adding supplemental 
markup clarifying how documents instantiating a 
serialization format (such as \XML{}) relate 
to the coding protocols and data types of 
software that reads or creates these documents.}

\p{For maximum expressivity, \MOSAIC{} introduces a 
meta-serialization system that can be applied 
to languages more flexible than \XML{} --- notably 
\TAGML{} --- as well as to \XML{} 
proper.\footnote{See \bhref{http://www.balisage.net/Proceedings/vol21/print/HaentjensDekker01/BalisageVol21-HaentjensDekker01.html}.}
In effect, \MOSAIC{} provides parsers for an 
extended version of \TAGML{} which includes 
an additional \q{grounding} layer.  Grounding, 
in this context, means describing how 
elements in the markip --- nodes, attributes, 
and character sequences --- are \q{grounded} 
in application-level types, data fields, 
and other programming constructs.  \lMOSAIC{} 
provides parsers for this \q{Grounded \TAGML{}} 
(\GTagML{}) language as well as converters 
to output serialized data as conventional 
\XML{}, so that \GTagML{} specifications can 
be used in contexts (\MIFlowCyt{}, for instance) 
where ordinary \XML{} is expected and serves 
as a basis of standardization.  \lMOSAIC{} also 
provides code libraries 
for extracting data from \GTagML{} documents.}

\p{\lGTagML{} documents, 
with certain restrictions enforced, are structurally 
isomorphic to \XML{} and can be rendered as 
pure \XML{}; as such, \GTagML{} schemata can 
be used to define norms for \XML{} languages, 
although the logical role and operations of such requirements 
is not identical to \XML{} schema definitions.  
By design, \GTagML{} schemata operate on 
two levels: first, they constrain 
the organization of \GTagML{} files themselves; 
and second, they stipulate how \GTagML{} document 
structure relates to the type systems of 
code libraries serializing and deserializing 
\GTagML{} files.  To model the second level of 
metadata, \GTagML{} introduces a hypergraph-based 
type model organized around \q{infosets,} which 
are structured overviews of application-level 
data types.  To fully utilize \GTagML{} features, 
programmers may consequently compose \q{infoset classes} 
as wrappers around ordinary data types 
(e.g., \Cpp{} classes), whose instances are 
serialized via nodes or character strings 
within \GTagML{} documents.  Infoset classes 
provide hypergraph \q{views} onto type-instances, 
and act as a bridge between data types and 
their associated \GTagML{} schema.  In particular, 
infoset classes (rather than the types 
they encapsulate) are the basis for schematizing 
the relation between \GTagML{} document elements 
and type instances (and the data they contain).}

\p{The hypergraph-based modeling incorporated 
into \GTagML{} reuses much of the code associated 
with \ConceptsDB{}, the new hypergraph database 
being developed alongside \MOSAIC{}.  More information 
about \ConceptsDB{} --- and on the 
\HTXN{} text encoding protocol for \MOSAIC{} portal 
manuscripts, mentioned earlier --- can be found on 
the guthub project page for Linguistic 
Technology Systems (\bhref{https://github.com/Mosaic-DigammaDB/LingTechSys}).}
