\begin{abstract}This chapter will explore the integration of several methodologies 
related to source code analysis and software Requirements 
Engineering.  In particular, I will review Semantic Web 
and general graph-based representations of source code, 
alongside applied type theory (for expressing 
programming languages' type systems).  The purpose of this 
integration is to develop a systematic (albeit not 
rigorously mathematical) account of foundational programming 
elements such as functions/procedures, function calls, and 
inter-procedure information flows.  The principal relatively new 
representational device I suggest here involves a theory 
of \q{channels} which ties together models associated with 
lambda calculi, type theory, and graph-based code representation.  
I argue that the perspective afforded by channels permits 
succinct protocols for describing procedural 
semantics/types and holistic program behavior.  I 
outline how the proposed techniques support documentation and 
verification of procedural, data type, and holistic 
specifications \mdash{} implementational assumptions on procedures  
and/or modeling assumptions on types.   
We need new methodologies for indicating and testing 
programming assumptions/specifications, I believe, insofar as 
there are several choices for handling requirements in 
a software context, each with their own trade-offs.  
Requirements Engineering protocols should therefore 
be developed within the foundational planning and 
prototyping stages of a project, particularly 
in CyberPhysical contexts which tend to exhibit both 
empirically-driven data types (with granular 
modeling parameters) and strong robustness/safety mandates.
For concrete examles, an accompanying open-source \mbox{data set (at 
\url{https://github.com/scignscape/ntxh}) 
demonstrates code libraries concretizing 
techniques outlined here.}
