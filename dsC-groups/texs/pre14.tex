{The final three screenshots show an example of how a 
custom-designed application can 
facilitate the task of building 
an annotated corpus from a linguistics text.  
The components demonstrated here enable 
several strategies (which can be combined) for describing 
parsing structures and the logical 
composition of language samples:

\begin{description}
\item[S-Expressions] Representing linguistic units as 
semantic and syntactic transformations 
triggered by words assigned to \curlyquote{functional} 
types.
\item[Dependency Grammar] Representing phrase structures via inter-word 
syntactic relationships.
\item[Link Grammar] Representing linguistic structure via connectors 
internal to each word-sense.  Inter-word links are activated when 
each word in the pair has a connector compatible with the 
other word's connector.  Intuitively, a connctor represents 
how one word's meaning or grammatic contribution can 
be \curlyquote{completed} by linking to a separate word.
