In addition to interactive visualization, 
Dataset Applications are useful pedagogic tools.  Within Dataset Applications, 
modeling units such as statistical parameters 
and record fields are visible in situ within a GUI 
--- identified by labels, buttons, and other interactive 
micro-controls.  As a result, users encounter 
modeling elements in a structured visual-interactive context.  
To help the reader learn more about modeling elements, 
Dataset Applications 
are equipped with several pedagogic features (which are 
shown on the following slides):

\begin{description}
\item[\curlyquote{About} Dialogs] Brief summaries of research terms and parameters.
\item[XPDF Links] Links back to research articles read in an embedded PDF viewer.
\item[XPDF Enhancements] The XPDF viewer can be customized for each data set 
and included with dataset code, with extra features to integrate article 
or book texts with Dataset Applications.
