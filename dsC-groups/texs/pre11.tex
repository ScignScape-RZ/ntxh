The remaining screenshots demonstrate how data sets can be 
used even outside of a lab contxt generating 
experiment data.  The pictured data set represents a corpus 
of linguistic examples mined from Wiley's \textit{Blackwell Handbook 
of Pragmatics}.  Creating data sets from book-length publications 
can encompass several steps:

\begin{description}
\item[Text Mining] In the case of linguistics, this involves 
locating example sentences within linguistics texts and 
storing them as an independent corpus.
\item[Canonical Formatting] If possible, linguistics 
texts should be annotated so that extracting exmples can be automated.
\item[Annotation] Linguistic corpuses are often annotated 
to identify structural details, beyond raw text, in 
each sample.
