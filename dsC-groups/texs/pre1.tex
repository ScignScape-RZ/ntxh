The code for each dsC data set includes a 
customized \curlyquote{Dataset Application} which displays 
individual samples and groups of samples via 
2D, 3D, and native-compiled GUI controls.

The following screenshots will 
show several examples of these features, such as:

\item[Specialized Top-Level Controls] Tree Widgets, Stacked Widgets, and Graphics Scenes.
\item[Context Menus] Systematically organize functionality around UI layouts.
