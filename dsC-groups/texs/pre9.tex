Although ordinary users can explore and visualize 
dsC data sets \curlyquote{Out of the Box}, advanced 
users have many options for customizing their 
build of the application in terms of their specific 
roles and available 3rd-party libraries.  These 
fine-tuning possibilities include:

\begin{description}
\item[Test Suites] Tools for creating and/or running test suites to 
ensure that the Dataset Application works across platforms.
\item[Data Export] Tools for reusing data in other projects.
\item[External Libraries] Some features --- such as XPDF and 
3D graphics --- require supplemental libraries that cannot 
be published with the data set in 
source code form.  Advanced users can select which of these 
libraries to incorporate into their version of the 
Dataset Application.
\item[Scripting] Data sets can compile their own scripting 
environment to automate testing and manipulation of research data.
\item[Networking] Dataset Applications can use an embedded 
TCP server to communicate with other applications, 
enabling multi-application workflows (this is also 
how testing is implemented).
